bolt-browser
============

Bolt browser testing. This project is superseded by bolt-karma test integration.


## Provenance

Bolt was initially developed to support products at [Ephox](http://ephox.com).

The library was open-sourced under a [BSD License](https://github.com/boltjs/bolt/blob/master/LICENSE), drawing users, support and improvements from a number of contributors.

The initial developers have since left the employment of Ephox and now
maintain the fork `boltjs/bolt`. This project was extracted from the
original bolt project for a number of reasons, but primarily it is
now superseded by the karma integration.
